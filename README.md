Level 1 - Task 6 - Bootstrap

Follow these steps:
● Create a catalogue page for an online store. The catalogue page lists the items
which are for sale.
○ Your catalogue page should have at least 10 items for sale. Include an image
and a brief description of each item.
○ Your page should include a form (don’t worry about functionality at this
stage).
○ Style this page using Bootstrap. Copy and paste the link to the Bootstrap
stylesheet into the head of your HTML pages. The link can be found here.
Choose a Bootstrap version at your discretion (currently on
version 4). You should be able to select the version of Bootstrap
from the top right-hand corner of the Bootstrap page.
Note: Be creative. You can style your page however you like as long as all the requirements
below are implemented with the use of the Bootstrap framework.
● Use a grid.
● Change your images to thumbnails. Add a comment that explains what a
thumbnail is according to Bootstrap.
● Format your images to have a responsive image attribute. Add a comment that
explains what a responsive image is.
● Create a table for your web page and format it as a hover table.
● Migrate your form to a horizontal form.
● Customise any implemented buttons.
● Customise multiple image/thumbnail shapes.
● Change all borders to have rounded edges and implement shadows for the boxes.
If using Bootstrap version 3, you can use CSS to implement this task
requirement.
